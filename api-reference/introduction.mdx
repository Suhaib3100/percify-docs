title: 'Percify API Overview'
description: 'Core concepts, authentication, and response patterns'
---

## Purpose
The Percify API lets you programmatically generate images, transform them into videos, synthesize voice audio, and retrieve published media assets. All endpoints follow predictable credit-based metering.

## Base URL
```
https://api.percify.io/v1
```

## Authentication
Use an API key in the `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```
Keys are scoped per user account. Rotate periodically and never embed client-side.

## Common Endpoints
| Action | Method | Path |
|--------|--------|------|
| Generate Image | POST | /images/generate |
| Video From Image | POST | /videos/from-image |
| Clone Voice | POST | /voices/clone |
| Generate Audio | POST | /audio/generate |
| Avatar Metadata | GET | /avatars/{avatarId} |
| Credit Balance | GET | /credits/balance |

## Response Pattern
Successful async generation requests return a processing object:
```json
{
  "id": "img_123",
  "status": "processing",
  "creditCost": 5,
  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T12:34:56Z"
}
```
Poll the status endpoint (same resource path) until `status` becomes `completed`.

## Errors
| Status | Meaning | Typical Cause |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 400 | Bad request | Missing required field / invalid duration |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing or bad API key |
| 403 | Forbidden | Banned user or restricted asset |
| 404 | Not found | Invalid resource id |
| 429 | Rate limited | Too many requests in window |
| 500 | Server error | Internal failure; retry later |

## Idempotency (Recommended)
For operations that could be retried (e.g., payment intent creation), include an `Idempotency-Key` header. Future endpoints may enforce uniqueness for safety.

## Webhooks (Planned)
Upcoming event types:
- `avatar.generated`
- `video.completed`
- `audio.completed`
- `credits.updated`

## OpenAPI Specification
The full schema resides in `api-reference/openapi.json`. Use it to generate client SDKs or validate requests.
