## Overview
Percify authenticates programmatic access via static API keys scoped to a user account. Keys must be kept server-side—never expose them in client bundles.

## Obtaining a Key
1. Visit Dashboard → Settings → API Keys
2. Generate new key (label for internal tracking)
3. Copy once; regenerate if leaked

## Request Format
Include header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```
Content-Type header required for JSON POST bodies.

## Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/images/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"vibrant portrait, rim light"}'
```

## Verifying Identity
Server resolves the user from key → attaches userId in request context → ban & credit checks applied.

## Rotation Strategy
| Scenario | Action |
|----------|-------|
| Routine security | Rotate quarterly |
| Suspected leak | Revoke + regenerate immediately |
| Ownership transfer | Delete old keys before handoff |

## Handling Failures
| Status | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| 401 | Missing/invalid key | Provide valid header |
| 403 | Banned user | Appeal or resolve violation |
| 429 | Rate limit | Backoff + retry |

## Storing Keys
| Environment | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| Local Dev | `.env.local` (never commit) |
| CI/CD | Platform secret manager |
| Production | Vault / encrypted secrets store |

## Do Not
- Embed in client-side JavaScript
- Log full key values
- Share keys across unrelated services
