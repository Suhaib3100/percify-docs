## Overview
Percify maintains platform safety through automated and manual moderation, a comprehensive ban system, privacy-respecting data handling, and proactive abuse prevention. This page explains policies and enforcement mechanisms from a user perspective.

## Content Moderation

### What Gets Moderated
| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Explicit NSFW content | Automatic flag + human review |
| Hate speech / harassment | Immediate takedown |
| Copyright violations | DMCA process + removal |
| Spam / bot activity | Rate limiting + ban |
| Impersonation | Account suspension |

### Visibility Controls
Users can set avatar/video visibility:
- **Public** – Appears in feed/explore, shareable links
- **Private** – Owner-only access; still usable for video/voice pipelines
- **Archived** – Hidden but retained in account

Admins can override visibility for policy violations.

## Ban System

### Ban Reasons
| Violation | Typical Action |
|-----------|---------------|
| Repeated policy breach | Temporary ban (7–30 days) |
| Severe ToS violation | Permanent ban |
| Credit exploit / abuse | Immediate permanent ban |
| Automated scraping | IP + account ban |

### Ban Effects
When banned:
1. All API requests return `403 Forbidden`
2. Dashboard login blocked with ban notice
3. All user avatars archived (set private, soft-deleted)
4. Active sessions invalidated
5. Public profile hidden

### Technical Implementation
Backend API routes check `requireNotBanned(userId)` utility before processing generation requests. Database columns:
- `banned` (boolean)
- `banned_at` (timestamp)
- `banned_reason` (text)

### Appeal Process
1. Contact support via email with account details
2. Provide context for appeal
3. Review typically completes within 3–5 business days
4. Unbanning does NOT auto-restore archived avatars (manual restoration available on request)

## Privacy & Data Handling

### What We Collect
| Data Type | Purpose | Retention |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Email, username | Authentication, support | Account lifetime |
| Generated avatars/videos | Service delivery | Until user deletes or account closed |
| Credit transactions | Billing, audit | 7 years (legal requirement) |
| API logs | Performance, debugging | 30 days |
| Usage analytics | Feature improvement | Aggregated, anonymized |

### What We Don't Sell
- Personal identity data
- Individual generation prompts
- User behavior profiles

### GDPR / CCPA Rights
Users can:
- **Access** – Download all personal data via dashboard export
- **Delete** – Request full account deletion (30-day grace period)
- **Portability** – Export avatars, videos, metadata in JSON
- **Opt-out** – Disable analytics tracking

Contact `privacy@percify.io` to exercise rights.

## Exploit Prevention

### Credit Abuse Detection
System monitors:
- Rapid repeat generation of identical prompts
- Unusual refund request patterns
- Multiple accounts from same IP/device
- Webhook replay attacks

Auto-response:
1. Suspend credit allocation
2. Flag account for review
3. Temporary generation freeze

### Rate Limiting (Per User)
| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Image generation | 100/hour |
| Video generation | 50/hour |
| Voice cloning | 10/hour |
| API reads (metadata) | 1000/hour |

Burst allowance: 2x limit for 60 seconds, then strict enforcement.

### Payment Fraud
- Stripe Radar detects suspicious card activity
- High-risk transactions require manual review before credit allocation
- Chargeback triggers automatic investigation

## Content Reporting

### User Reporting
Any public avatar/video includes a "Report" action:
1. Select violation type (NSFW, harassment, copyright, other)
2. Optional description
3. Submitted to moderation queue

Average review time: <24 hours.

### Automated Scanning
- NSFW classifier runs on all public image outputs
- Text prompt filtering for known abuse patterns
- Audio content safety checks (planned)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep API key secret | Prevent unauthorized usage |
| Enable 2FA (when available) | Protect account access |
| Review credit history | Detect unauthorized activity |
| Use strong passwords | Standard security hygiene |

### For Integrators
- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Implement client-side rate limiting to stay under quotas
- Validate webhook signatures (when available)
- Log API errors for debugging without exposing keys

## Incident Response

### If Your Account Is Compromised
1. Immediately regenerate API key via dashboard
2. Review recent credit transactions for unauthorized usage
3. Change password
4. Contact support if fraudulent charges detected

### If You Receive a Ban Notification
1. Review the stated reason carefully
2. If incorrect, prepare evidence for appeal
3. Email support with:
   - Account email
   - Ban timestamp
   - Context/explanation
   - Supporting screenshots/logs

## Platform Integrity

### Uptime & Reliability
- Target: 99.9% API availability
- Status page: `status.percify.io` (planned)
- Scheduled maintenance announced 48 hours in advance

### Data Redundancy
- Postgres backups: daily snapshots, 30-day retention
- Object storage: multi-region replication
- Disaster recovery: 4-hour RTO, 15-minute RPO targets

### Compliance
- SOC 2 Type II (in progress)
- GDPR compliant
- CCPA compliant
- PCI DSS via Stripe

## Transparency Reports (Planned)
Quarterly publication of:
- Total moderation actions
- Ban counts by category
- DMCA takedown requests
- Data access requests processed

## Standard Error Responses
| Status | Case | Body |
|--------|------|------|
| 401 | Missing auth | `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }` |
| 403 | Banned user | `{ "error": "Access denied", "reason": "banned" }` |
| 429 | Rate limit | `{ "error": "Too Many Requests" }` |
| 400 | Validation | `{ "error": "Invalid input" }` |

## Logging & Audit
Log structure suggestion:
```json
{
  "type": "ban_check",
  "userId": "usr_123",
  "result": "blocked",
  "route": "/api/images/generate",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-24T12:45:00Z"
}
```

## User Data Privacy (High Level)
- Minimal PII stored (email, optional display name)
- Media assets segregated by userId
- Token-based API access (no password sharing)

## Incident Response (Recommended Steps)
1. Detect anomaly (logs / alerts)
2. Temporarily ban account (script)
3. Archive related assets
4. Review root cause
5. Restore or escalate permanent ban
