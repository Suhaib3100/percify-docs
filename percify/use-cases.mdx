## Overview
Percify enables rapid creation and personalization of media-rich AI avatars. Below are common patterns and how to implement them efficiently with credits and API endpoints.

## Marketing Content Generation
Produce a themed avatar series for a product launch:
1. Define brand style keywords ("neon accent", "clean tech", "gradient rim light").
2. Batch generate 4–6 avatar variants using Standard model for iteration.
3. Upgrade final selections with Premium for fidelity.
4. Animate top avatars into 5s clips (base cost only) for social teasers.
5. Optional voice line to reinforce messaging.

## Personalized User Profiles
Allow end users to create stylized AI profile pictures:
1. Collect initial prompt/style preferences.
2. Generate single Standard output (2 credits) for speed.
3. Offer refinement / premium upgrade path.
4. Store resulting avatarId and make it available in profile UI.

## Short Form Video Pipeline
Turn daily avatar prompts into snackable video content:
1. Morning batch of 10 prompts → images.
2. Select top 3 for animation (≤8s each).
3. Generate a short voice line per video.
4. Publish and tag for feed discovery.

## Educational Narration
Use consistent cloned voice across multiple learning clips:
1. Clone clear voice profile once (5 credits).
2. Generate short scripted audio lines; keep videos ≤10s for credit control.
3. Reuse same avatar style for brand continuity.

## Community Spotlight Features
Weekly spotlight on user-created avatars:
1. Query top liked avatars via feed endpoints.
2. Animate winning avatar with a "spotlight" motion style.
3. Attach congratulatory voice narration.
4. Publish as featured content (visibility flag).

## Multi-Character Scene (Avatar Cast)
Create a composite scene for storytelling:
1. Generate individual avatars separately.
2. Use Avatar Cast feature (30 credits) for combined scene.
3. Animate scene with subtle movement; optional group voice line.

## API Chaining Example
```mermaid
graph LR;
  A[Prompt Input] --> B[Image Generation];
  B --> C[Video From Image];
  C --> D[Audio Generation];
  D --> E[Publish];
```

## Cost Optimization Tips
| Goal | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| Minimum spend | Use Standard model for initial draft |
| High fidelity | Switch to Premium only for final output |
| Video scale | Keep most clips at base 5s duration |
| Voice consistency | Reuse cloned voice; avoid re-cloning |
| Rapid iteration | Limit variants per prompt to 2–3 |

## Monitoring & Iteration
- Track credit usage spikes with dashboard summaries.
- Use performance logs to adjust video durations during peak load.
- Periodically rotate prompts for freshness in content feeds.
