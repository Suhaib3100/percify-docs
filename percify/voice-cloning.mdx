description: "Create reusable voice profiles and generate speech"
---

## Overview
Voice cloning lets you build a voice profile from a clean sample and then synthesize natural speech lines to pair with video avatars. Two cost phases: cloning and per-second generation.

## Credit Model
| Phase | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Clone Voice (profile creation) | 5 credits |
| Generate Speech | 5 base + 1/sec |

## Source Sample Guidelines
| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Length | 15–60 seconds |
| Format | WAV or high-bitrate MP3 |
| Environment | Quiet, minimal reverb |
| Content | Diverse phonemes, clear articulation |

## Workflow
1. Upload source sample in Studio (or API)
2. Cloning job processes & registers voiceId
3. Use voiceId for subsequent speech synthesis
4. Attach generated audio to video clip or export standalone

## Step-by-Step: Clone & Generate Voice

### Step 1: Prepare Source Sample
**Recording Guidelines:**
- **Duration:** 15–60 seconds optimal
- **Environment:** Quiet room, no echo
- **Content:** Varied sentences with natural intonation
- **Microphone:** Use best available (phone is OK if quiet)
- **Format:** WAV, FLAC, or high-bitrate MP3 (320kbps)

**Sample Script (Example):**
```
"Hello, this is my voice sample for cloning. I'm recording in a quiet space
with clear pronunciation. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
I'll vary my tone to capture natural speech patterns. Thank you!"
```

### Step 2: Upload & Clone
1. Navigate to Studio → Voice → Clone New
2. Click "Upload Sample" or drag file
3. Optional: Add voice profile name ("Professional", "Casual", etc.)
4. Click "Clone Voice" → job starts
5. Status updates: `uploading` → `processing` → `ready`
6. Typical processing: 2–5 minutes
7. Cost: **5 credits** (one-time per profile)

### Step 3: Save Voice Profile
- Once ready, voiceId generated (e.g., `voice_abc123`)
- Profile appears in Voice Library
- Reusable for unlimited generations
- Can create multiple profiles (different styles/tones)

### Step 4: Generate Speech
**Via UI:**
1. Open Voice Library → select cloned profile
2. Enter text to synthesize (max 500 words per generation)
3. Preview cost: `5 (base) + duration_seconds × 1`
4. Click "Generate" → audio renders
5. Download or attach to video

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/audio/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "voiceId": "voice_abc123",
    "text": "Welcome to Percify. Create amazing AI avatars with just a few clicks."
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "audio_xyz789",
  "status": "processing",
  "duration": 8,
  "creditCost": 13,
  "voiceId": "voice_abc123"
}
```

### Step 5: Attach to Video (Optional)
1. Open video in Studio
2. Click "Add Audio Track"
3. Select from Voice Library or generate new
4. Auto-sync or manual timing adjustment
5. Preview combined result
6. Export final video with audio

## Workflow

## API Examples
Clone voice:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/voices/clone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -F file=@sample.wav
```
Generate speech:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/audio/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"voiceId":"voice_123","text":"Exploring galaxies with Percify."}'
```

## Best Practices
| Goal | Tip |
|------|-----|
| Natural prosody | Provide expressive source sample |
| Clarity | Avoid background hum/noise |
| Rapid iteration | Reuse cloned profile for batches |
| Sync with video | Match sentence length to clip duration |

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Metallic artifacts | Low bitrate or noisy source | Re-record sample |
| Wrong pacing | Text lacks punctuation | Add commas / periods |
| Credit spike | Long scripted monologue | Split into segments |
| Desync | Mismatched durations | Adjust video length or trim audio |
