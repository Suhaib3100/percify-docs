description: "Create reusable voice profiles and generate speech"

## Overview
Voice cloning lets you build a voice profile from a clean sample and then synthesize natural speech lines to pair with video avatars. Two cost phases: cloning and per-second generation.

## Credit Model
| Phase | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Clone Voice (profile creation) | 5 credits |
| Generate Speech | 5 base + 1/sec |

## Source Sample Guidelines
| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Length | 15–60 seconds |
| Format | WAV or high-bitrate MP3 |
| Environment | Quiet, minimal reverb |
| Content | Diverse phonemes, clear articulation |

## Workflow
1. Upload source sample in Studio (or API)
2. Cloning job processes & registers voiceId
3. Use voiceId for subsequent speech synthesis
4. Attach generated audio to video clip or export standalone

## API Examples
Clone voice:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/voices/clone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -F file=@sample.wav
```
Generate speech:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/audio/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"voiceId":"voice_123","text":"Exploring galaxies with Percify."}'
```

## Best Practices
| Goal | Tip |
|------|-----|
| Natural prosody | Provide expressive source sample |
| Clarity | Avoid background hum/noise |
| Rapid iteration | Reuse cloned profile for batches |
| Sync with video | Match sentence length to clip duration |

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Metallic artifacts | Low bitrate or noisy source | Re-record sample |
| Wrong pacing | Text lacks punctuation | Add commas / periods |
| Credit spike | Long scripted monologue | Split into segments |
| Desync | Mismatched durations | Adjust video length or trim audio |
