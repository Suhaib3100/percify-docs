## Overview
The Avatar Studio is the central interface for generating, refining, and publishing AI avatars. It unifies image generation, video transformation, and audio pairing.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description | Credit Impact |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Prompt | Text describing desired avatar style/content | Cost per image output |
| Refinement | Iterative prompt/style adjustments | New generation cost |
| Publish | Make avatar visible in feed/explore | No additional cost |
| Private Avatar | Hidden from public but usable for downstream features | Standard generation cost |
| Cast | Multi-avatar, scene-based creation | Higher base (Avatar Cast) |

## Typical Workflow
1. Enter a concise, vivid prompt ("celestial explorer portrait, iridescent nebula background, soft rim light")
2. Select model tier (Standard vs Premium)
3. Generate 1–4 outputs
4. Choose favorite, refine or upscale
5. Publish or keep private
6. (Optional) Start Image → Video pipeline or clone voice

## Step-by-Step: Your First Avatar

### Step 1: Access Avatar Studio
- Navigate to Dashboard → Studio → Avatar
- Or use the "Create" button from main navigation

### Step 2: Craft Your Prompt
**Formula:** `[Subject] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Atmosphere]`

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: "futuristic astronaut, cyberpunk neon, rim light, misty atmosphere"
✅ Good: "elegant portrait, Renaissance style, golden hour, soft focus"
❌ Too vague: "cool person"
❌ Too complex: "astronaut with red suit blue helmet standing on mars with..."
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Keep prompts under 20 words
- Use 2–3 descriptive adjectives max
- Specify lighting for consistent results
- Add artistic style for unique aesthetics

### Step 3: Choose Model & Outputs
| Model | Speed | Quality | Cost | Best For |
|-------|-------|---------|------|----------|
| Standard (Flux) | Fast | Good | 2 credits | Iteration, drafts |
| Premium (Imagen3) | Slower | Excellent | 5 credits | Final, hero images |

**Output Count:** Start with 2–3 variants for comparison.

### Step 4: Generate & Review
- Click "Generate" → watch status indicator
- Typical generation: 15–45 seconds
- Review all outputs in grid view
- Hover for quick actions (favorite, download, delete)

### Step 5: Refine (Optional)
**Refinement Strategies:**
- **Adjust prompt:** Add or remove keywords
- **Change style:** Try different artistic directions
- **Upscale:** Enhance resolution for final output
- **Regenerate:** Same prompt, different seed

### Step 6: Publish or Keep Private
**Publishing:**
- Sets visibility to "Public" (appears in feed/explore)
- Generates shareable URL
- Enables likes/comments
- Cannot be fully undone (can archive later)

**Keeping Private:**
- Only you can access
- Still usable for video/voice pipelines
- No credit difference
- Can publish later

## Typical Workflow

## UI Sections
| Section | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Prompt Input | Core descriptive text & style modifiers |
| Output Grid | Shows generated variants; supports selection & actions |
| Details Panel | Metadata: model, cost, timestamps, visibility |
| Action Bar | Regenerate, upscale, video transform, voice attach |
| Cost Summary | Dynamic display of expected credit usage before confirmation |

## Best Practices
- Use 1–2 stylistic keywords + 1 subject + 1 lighting descriptor.
- Avoid overstuffing prompts; let refinement handle nuance.
- Keep initial generation output count low for faster iteration.
- Favor Premium models for cinematic realism (Reality4 / Imagen3).

## Image to Video Transition
From selected image use "Animate" or "Image → Video" action:
- Choose duration (5s base recommended)
- Pick motion style (subtle pan, dynamic zoom, parallax)
- Preview cost before confirmation

## Cost Preview Logic (Pseudo)
```typescript
const cost = duration <= 5
  ? videoCosts.base
  : videoCosts.base + (duration - 5) * videoCosts.perSecond;
```

## Voice Integration
After video generation, attach existing cloned voice or generate new line:
1. Select voice profile
2. Enter text (TTS) or upload recorded sample for mixing
3. Duration cost applies to audio generation

## Publishing & Visibility
| State | Feed Visible | API Accessible | Modifiable |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Draft | No | Yes (authenticated) | Yes |
| Published | Yes | Yes (public endpoints) | Limited |
| Private | No | Yes (owner only) | Yes |

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Blurry outputs | Prompt too vague or upscale skipped | Refine prompt, use upscale |
| Repetitive poses | Model bias | Add dynamic action keywords |
| High credit burn | Generating many variants | Limit initial outputs |
| Dark/overlit images | Lighting mismatch | Add "soft rim light" or "balanced studio lighting" |
