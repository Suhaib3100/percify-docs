## Overview
The Avatar Studio is the central interface for generating, refining, and publishing AI avatars. It unifies image generation, video transformation, and audio pairing.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description | Credit Impact |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Prompt | Text describing desired avatar style/content | Cost per image output |
| Refinement | Iterative prompt/style adjustments | New generation cost |
| Publish | Make avatar visible in feed/explore | No additional cost |
| Private Avatar | Hidden from public but usable for downstream features | Standard generation cost |
| Cast | Multi-avatar, scene-based creation | Higher base (Avatar Cast) |

## Typical Workflow
1. Enter a concise, vivid prompt ("celestial explorer portrait, iridescent nebula background, soft rim light")
2. Select model tier (Standard vs Premium)
3. Generate 1–4 outputs
4. Choose favorite, refine or upscale
5. Publish or keep private
6. (Optional) Start Image → Video pipeline or clone voice

## UI Sections
| Section | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Prompt Input | Core descriptive text & style modifiers |
| Output Grid | Shows generated variants; supports selection & actions |
| Details Panel | Metadata: model, cost, timestamps, visibility |
| Action Bar | Regenerate, upscale, video transform, voice attach |
| Cost Summary | Dynamic display of expected credit usage before confirmation |

## Best Practices
- Use 1–2 stylistic keywords + 1 subject + 1 lighting descriptor.
- Avoid overstuffing prompts; let refinement handle nuance.
- Keep initial generation output count low for faster iteration.
- Favor Premium models for cinematic realism (Reality4 / Imagen3).

## Image to Video Transition
From selected image use "Animate" or "Image → Video" action:
- Choose duration (5s base recommended)
- Pick motion style (subtle pan, dynamic zoom, parallax)
- Preview cost before confirmation

## Cost Preview Logic (Pseudo)
```typescript
const cost = duration <= 5
  ? videoCosts.base
  : videoCosts.base + (duration - 5) * videoCosts.perSecond;
```

## Voice Integration
After video generation, attach existing cloned voice or generate new line:
1. Select voice profile
2. Enter text (TTS) or upload recorded sample for mixing
3. Duration cost applies to audio generation

## Publishing & Visibility
| State | Feed Visible | API Accessible | Modifiable |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Draft | No | Yes (authenticated) | Yes |
| Published | Yes | Yes (public endpoints) | Limited |
| Private | No | Yes (owner only) | Yes |

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Blurry outputs | Prompt too vague or upscale skipped | Refine prompt, use upscale |
| Repetitive poses | Model bias | Add dynamic action keywords |
| High credit burn | Generating many variants | Limit initial outputs |
| Dark/overlit images | Lighting mismatch | Add "soft rim light" or "balanced studio lighting" |
