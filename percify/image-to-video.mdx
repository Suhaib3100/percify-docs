title: "Image to Video"
description: "Convert a static avatar into a short animated clip"
---

## Overview
Image → Video transforms a generated avatar still into a motion clip. Credit usage scales with duration and feature type (Video Studio vs Reality Lab for cinematic output).

## Duration & Credits
| Feature | Base (≤5s) | Increment (>5s) | Example (12s) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Video Studio | 30 | +6/sec | 30 + (7 * 6) = 72 |
| Reality Lab | 20 | +4/sec | 20 + (7 * 4) = 48 |

Formula:
```
if seconds <= 5: cost = base
else: cost = base + (seconds - 5) * perSecond
```

## Workflow
1. Select a published or draft avatar image
2. Click "Animate" / "Image → Video"
3. Choose feature type (Studio / Reality Lab)
4. Set duration (recommend 5–8s for social snippets)
5. Pick motion style (pan, zoom, parallax, subtle expression change)
6. Preview credit cost & confirm
7. Track generation status; result appears in video library
8. (Optional) Attach or generate an audio track

## Step-by-Step: Create Your First Video

### Step 1: Select Source Image
- Open Avatar Studio or Dashboard
- Choose an existing avatar image
- Look for "Animate" or "Convert to Video" button
- Preview shows estimated generation time

### Step 2: Choose Video Feature
| Feature | Style | Base Cost | Per-Sec Cost | Best For |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Video Studio | Dynamic, vibrant | 30 credits | +6/sec | Social media, marketing |
| Reality Lab | Cinematic, subtle | 20 credits | +4/sec | Storytelling, premium content |

### Step 3: Set Duration
**Duration Guidelines:**
```
5s  = Base cost only (30 or 20 credits)
8s  = Base + 3 additional seconds
10s = Base + 5 additional seconds
15s = Base + 10 additional seconds (higher cost)
```

**Recommendation:** Start with 5–8s clips for optimal cost/impact ratio.

### Step 4: Select Motion Style
| Style | Effect | Best For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Parallax** | Depth-based layer movement | Landscape, scenic avatars |
| **Pan** | Smooth horizontal/vertical slide | Portrait, character shots |
| **Zoom** | Gradual zoom in/out | Dramatic reveals |
| **Subtle** | Minimal ambient motion | Professional, subtle content |
| **Expression** | Facial animation | Character-focused content |

### Step 5: Review Cost & Confirm
Cost calculator shows:
```
Video Studio (8s)
= 30 (base) + (8-5) × 6
= 30 + 18
= 48 credits
```

### Step 6: Monitor Generation
- Status: `queued` → `processing` → `completed`
- Typical time: 30–90 seconds
- Email notification on completion (if enabled)
- Video appears in Studio → Videos library

### Step 7: Preview & Download
- Click video thumbnail for preview
- Download in original quality
- Share public URL (if published)
- Add to existing projects

## Workflow

## API Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/videos/from-image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "imageId": "img_123",
    "durationSeconds": 8,
    "mode": "studio",
    "motionStyle": "parallax"
  }'
```
Response:
```json
{
  "id": "vid_456",
  "status": "processing",
  "creditCost": 48,
  "estimatedSeconds": 15
}
```

## Performance Notes
- Shorter durations reduce queue time
- Reality Lab optimized for cinematic motion at lower incremental cost
- Reuse existing images rather than regenerating similar prompts

## Best Practices
| Goal | Tip |
|------|-----|
| Natural motion | Keep duration ≤10s |
| Social share | Use Studio mode for vibrant action |
| Cinematic feel | Choose Reality Lab + slower parallax |
| Cost control | Stay at base 5s for previews |

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Jerky motion | Motion style too aggressive | Select subtle pan |
| High cost | Long duration chosen | Reduce seconds or switch mode |
| Generation timeout | Provider overload | Retry or lower concurrency |
| Blended artifacts | Source image low quality | Regenerate higher fidelity image |
