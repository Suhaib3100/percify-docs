title: "Image to Video"
description: "Convert a static avatar into a short animated clip"

## Overview
Image → Video transforms a generated avatar still into a motion clip. Credit usage scales with duration and feature type (Video Studio vs Reality Lab for cinematic output).

## Duration & Credits
| Feature | Base (≤5s) | Increment (>5s) | Example (12s) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Video Studio | 30 | +6/sec | 30 + (7 * 6) = 72 |
| Reality Lab | 20 | +4/sec | 20 + (7 * 4) = 48 |

Formula:
```
if seconds <= 5: cost = base
else: cost = base + (seconds - 5) * perSecond
```

## Workflow
1. Select a published or draft avatar image
2. Click "Animate" / "Image → Video"
3. Choose feature type (Studio / Reality Lab)
4. Set duration (recommend 5–8s for social snippets)
5. Pick motion style (pan, zoom, parallax, subtle expression change)
6. Preview credit cost & confirm
7. Track generation status; result appears in video library
8. (Optional) Attach or generate an audio track

## API Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.percify.io/v1/videos/from-image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERCIFY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "imageId": "img_123",
    "durationSeconds": 8,
    "mode": "studio",
    "motionStyle": "parallax"
  }'
```
Response:
```json
{
  "id": "vid_456",
  "status": "processing",
  "creditCost": 48,
  "estimatedSeconds": 15
}
```

## Performance Notes
- Shorter durations reduce queue time
- Reality Lab optimized for cinematic motion at lower incremental cost
- Reuse existing images rather than regenerating similar prompts

## Best Practices
| Goal | Tip |
|------|-----|
| Natural motion | Keep duration ≤10s |
| Social share | Use Studio mode for vibrant action |
| Cinematic feel | Choose Reality Lab + slower parallax |
| Cost control | Stay at base 5s for previews |

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Jerky motion | Motion style too aggressive | Select subtle pan |
| High cost | Long duration chosen | Reduce seconds or switch mode |
| Generation timeout | Provider overload | Retry or lower concurrency |
| Blended artifacts | Source image low quality | Regenerate higher fidelity image |
