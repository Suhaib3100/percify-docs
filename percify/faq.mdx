## General
**Q: What is Percify?**  
A platform for generating, animating, and voicing AI avatars with a transparent credit model.

**Q: Do credits expire?**  
Not currently. Future enterprise tiers may introduce rollover policies.

## Credits & Billing
**Q: Why did my credits decrease unexpectedly?**  
Likely due to longer video/audio durations. Check cost preview before confirming.

**Q: Can I reserve credits for queued jobs?**  
Reservation is a planned feature; today credits debit only on success.

## Generation
**Q: Outputs look repetitive—how to diversify?**  
Add action or environment keywords; refine with style adjustments.

**Q: Video feels choppy.**  
Use parallax or subtle pan styles; avoid extreme zoom on short clips.

## Voice
**Q: Audio has metallic noise.**  
Source sample quality too low. Re-record in a quiet space at higher bitrate.

**Q: Speech pacing is off.**  
Add punctuation for natural prosody.

## API
**Q: Getting 401 Unauthorized.**  
Missing or invalid `Authorization` header. Regenerate the key if unsure.

**Q: Receiving 403 despite valid key.**  
Account may be banned. See [/percify/security].

**Q: How to paginate feed results?**  
Use `?page` or cursor-based endpoints (future). Estimated counts provided to avoid heavy total scans.

## Performance
**Q: Why is dashboard slow after large imports?**  
Indexes may not exist or need ANALYZE. Re-run optimization migration and monitor timings.

**Q: Video generation queued.**  
Peak concurrency; retry later or shorten duration.

## Safety & Moderation
**Q: Can I appeal a ban?**  
Yes—contact support with your user handle and reason.

**Q: How do I hide content?**  
Set avatar/video visibility to Private; remains accessible to you via API.

## Troubleshooting Table
